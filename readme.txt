The Genesis Widget Background allows you to set a background for your featured page widget. You can use the featured image, a custom image or a color. 

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin only works on the <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/" title="Genesis Framework" rel="nofollow">Genesis Framework</a>

**Disclaimer:** This plugin is essentially a forked version of the  *Genesis - Featured Page Advanced* widget. Props go to StudioPress for developing the widget and Ndiego. I've used the orignal code as base to develop this plugin.


== Installation ==

	* *Go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Genesis Featured Page Advanced". Once found, click "Install".
	* *Download the folder from Wordpress.org and zip the folder. Then upload via Plugins->Add New->Upload.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). If you do not have Genesis 2.0+ or Wordpress 3.6+, the plugin will not activate.
